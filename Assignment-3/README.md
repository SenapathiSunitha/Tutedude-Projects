Task-1: Factorial of a Number
Description:
This Python program calculates the factorial of a user-entered number using recursion.

How It Works:
-The program defines a recursive function factorial(n):
-If n is 0 or 1, it returns 1 (base case).
-Otherwise, it returns n \* factorial(n - 1).
-The user is prompted to input a number.
-The factorial result is then printed.

Task-2: Basic Math Functions Using Python's math Module
Description:
This Python program demonstrates the use of the built-in math module to perform common mathematical operations on a number provided by the user.

Operations Performed:
-Square Root
-Natural Logarithm (base e)
-Sine

How It Works:
-The user is prompted to enter a number.
-Using the math module, the program calculates and prints:
-The square root using sqrt(x)
-The natural log using log(x)
-The sine using sin(x)
