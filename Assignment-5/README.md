-A dictionary named dict contains student names as keys and their marks as values.
-The user is prompted to enter a student's name.
-The program checks:
-If the name exists in the dictionary, it prints the student’s marks.
-If not, it prints "Student not found."

Task-2: Demonstrate List Slicing
Description:

How It Works:
-A list l containing numbers 1 to 10 is defined.
-The program prints:
-The original list.
-The first five elements using slicing (l[:5]).
-The reversed version of those five elements using reverse slicing (l[4::-1]).
