Task-1: Check Even or Odd Number
Description:
This Python program prompts the user to enter an integer and then checks whether the entered number is even or odd.

How It Works:
The user is asked to input a number using input().
The number is converted to an integer using int().
Using the modulo operator %, the program checks if the number is divisible by 2.
If a % 2 == 0, it is even.
Otherwise, it is odd.

The result is displayed using formatted string output.

Task-2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
Description:
This program calculates and prints the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

How It Works:
A variable sum is initialized to 0.
A for loop runs from 1 to 50 (inclusive), and each number is added to sum.
After the loop completes, the total sum is printed.
